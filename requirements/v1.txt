lets create api for sqlite

sqlbase.rontohub.com 

Write rest api contract
1) create table api
1) insert row for given table api 
1) list row api 

ChatGPT
Certainly, I can help you outline the REST API contract for interacting with an SQLite database. Please note that creating an actual API would require backend programming using a language like Python, Node.js, or another appropriate technology. Below is the contract for the three endpoints you mentioned: create table, insert row, and list rows.

API Endpoint 1: Create Table

URL: http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables
Method: POST
Request Body:
JSON object containing:
"table_name": The name of the table to be created.
"columns": An array of column definitions, each containing "name" and "type".
Response:
201 Created on success.
400 Bad Request if the request body is invalid.
500 Internal Server Error if there's an issue with creating the table.
API Endpoint 2: Insert Row

URL: http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables/{table_name}/rows
Method: POST
URL Parameters:
table_name: The name of the table where the row will be inserted.
Request Body:
JSON object containing key-value pairs for the columns and their values.
Response:
201 Created on success.
400 Bad Request if the request body is invalid.
404 Not Found if the specified table does not exist.
500 Internal Server Error if there's an issue with inserting the row.
API Endpoint 3: List Rows

URL: http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables/{table_name}/rows
Method: GET
URL Parameters:
table_name: The name of the table whose rows will be listed.
Response:
200 OK on success with a JSON array of rows, where each row is represented as a JSON object.
404 Not Found if the specified table does not exist.
500 Internal Server Error if there's an issue with retrieving the rows.
Please remember that this is just a high-level outline of the API contract. Actual implementation will involve creating backend code using a programming language and web framework of your choice. Additionally, ensure proper security measures such as input validation and authentication are implemented to protect the database and the API.

create table api  ,show tell which column is primary key, some column have default values
ChatGPT
Sure, I can provide more details for the "Create Table" API endpoint. Here's an expanded version of the API contract that includes primary key columns and columns with default values:

API Endpoint: Create Table

URL: http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables
Method: POST
Request Body:
JSON object containing:
"table_name": The name of the table to be created.
"columns": An array of column definitions, each containing:
"name": The name of the column.
"type": The data type of the column (e.g., TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, etc.).
"primary_key" (optional): Boolean indicating whether this column is a primary key.
"default" (optional): Default value for the column.
Response:
201 Created on success.
400 Bad Request if the request body is invalid.
500 Internal Server Error if there's an issue with creating the table.
Example Request Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "table_name": "employees",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "type": "INTEGER",
      "primary_key": true
    },
    {
      "name": "name",
      "type": "TEXT"
    },
    {
      "name": "email",
      "type": "TEXT",
      "default": "unknown@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": "INTEGER",
      "default": 25
    }
  ]
}
In this example, the "employees" table has four columns. The "id" column is marked as the primary key, and the "email" and "age" columns have default values set.

Please adapt this to your programming language and framework of choice for actual implementation. Also, ensure you handle errors and exceptions appropriately to provide meaningful responses to clients.

primary key can be autoincrement also
ChatGPT
Absolutely, primary keys can often be set to auto-increment, which means that the database system will automatically assign a unique value to the primary key column for each new row added. Here's how you could modify the column definition in the request body to indicate that a primary key column should be auto-incremented:

json
Copy code
{
  "table_name": "employees",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "type": "INTEGER",
      "primary_key": true,
      "auto_increment": true
    },
    {
      "name": "name",
      "type": "TEXT"
    },
    {
      "name": "email",
      "type": "TEXT",
      "default": "unknown@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": "INTEGER",
      "default": 25
    }
  ]
}
In this modified example, the "id" column is designated as the primary key and set to auto-increment. This way, the database system will automatically generate a unique value for the "id" column when a new row is inserted, eliminating the need for you to manually provide an ID.

As before, remember that this is a high-level representation, and the actual implementation would involve translating this request body into code using your chosen backend language and database library.

API Endpoint 2: Insert Row
generate sample api call for students
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a sample API call for inserting a row of student data using the "Insert Row" endpoint:

API Endpoint: Insert Row

URL: http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables/students/rows
Method: POST
URL Parameters:
table_name: "students"
Request Body:
JSON object containing key-value pairs for the columns and their values.
"name": The name of the student.
"age": The age of the student.
"email": The email address of the student.
Response:
201 Created on success.
400 Bad Request if the request body is invalid.
404 Not Found if the specified table does not exist.
500 Internal Server Error if there's an issue with inserting the row.
Example Request:

json
Copy code
POST http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables/students/rows
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 20,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
In this example, a new student named "John Doe" with an age of 20 and an email address "john.doe@example.com" is being added to the "students" table.

Again, this is a simplified example for illustration purposes. The actual implementation of the API call would depend on the programming language and framework you're using for your backend.




User
generate sample api call for insert row todo 
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a sample API call for inserting a new task (todo) into a hypothetical "todos" table using the "Insert Row" endpoint:

API Endpoint: Insert Row

URL: http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables/todos/rows
Method: POST
URL Parameters:
table_name: "todos"
Request Body:
JSON object containing key-value pairs for the columns and their values.
"task": The task description.
"priority": The priority level of the task.
"completed": A flag indicating whether the task is completed.
Response:
201 Created on success.
400 Bad Request if the request body is invalid.
404 Not Found if the specified table does not exist.
500 Internal Server Error if there's an issue with inserting the row.
Example Request:

json
Copy code
POST http://sqlbase.rontohub.com/tables/todos/rows
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task": "Buy groceries",
  "priority": "high",
  "completed": false
}
In this example, a new task "Buy groceries" with a priority level of "high" and marked as incomplete is being added to the "todos" table.

Remember that the actual implementation of this API call would depend on the backend programming language and framework you're using. This example assumes that the backend code will handle making HTTP requests and serializing/deserializing JSON data.




User

  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "age": 22,
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
  }
]
These examples demonstrate how the API calls would be made to retrieve lists of rows from the "todos" and "students" tables. The actual response structure and data may vary based on your specific implementation and database structure
